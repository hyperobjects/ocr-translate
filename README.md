# ocr-translate
extract text and translate documents


In this notebook, I demonstrate how to take a document in .pdf format, translate the text into various languages, then save the translation as a .txt file. <br>

An advantage that this script has over brower based translation services is there is no character limit. <br> <br>

The ideal use case for this script is when one has an unhighlightable .pdf written in one language for which one needs a translation on the fly. <br> <br>

The source text in this example is a Finnish language masters thesis on self-taught artist Paavo Pyhtilä. The source text was used with permission by its author, Pertti Pyhtilä. For the full text, check the input_dir folder or: https://jyx.jyu.fi/handle/123456789/38865
